# An arduino temperature sensor for a kettle

Want to make water for your chimarrao and wonder if the kettle has reached your sweet-spot temperature? This is a arduino based battery powered water temperature sensor to put into your kettle. As soon as the set temperature is reached, the sensor makes noise and the green LED lights up. 

## Parts List

- 1 x Arduino Nano
- 1 x DS18B20 waterproof temperature sensor
- 1 x 1/2 or 1/4 sized solderable breadboard (the STL is made for 1/4 size)
- 3 x 150 Ohm resistors
- 1 x green LED
- 2 x red LED
- 1 x battery holder for 4xAA or 4xAAA batteries
- 1 x switch
- 1 x piezo buzzer
- cables

## Assembly

When you solder the resistors directly to the LED's you get along with a 1/4 sized breadboard. Other than that, just put together, put everything into the box and you are ready to go
